# This page is for fundametal studying of Data structures 

1. Heaps

Heaps are suited for maintaining a list of items in order of priority. For example, if a marketing agency wants to prioritize projects that come up for higher-paying clients, it would lend itself to helping the agency achieve this by using a max-heap (opposite of min-heap) to constantly re-adjust our heap such that the highest paying client is the root of the heap.

2. Queues

Queues follow a FIFO (first in, first out) protocol, making them ideally suited to help a customer service desk, for instance, building some software that allows representatives to reply to tickets in the order they are received. Hence, the first customer ticket added will be the first one addressed.

3. Linked lists 

Linked lists are helpful in situations where you need to traverse a list or add to the end. If you've decided to build your own music playlist command line program, you may want to be able to select songs that starting with the first, add a new song to the end of the playlist and most importantly, skip to the next song. Stacks follow a LIFO (last in, first out) protocol and do not allow you to traverse a list. Therefore, you would model our playlist with a linked list and traverse the nodes to move to the next song. We can also enqueue() a song to the end of the playlist.
 
4. Stacks

When you've been asked to add "undo" functionality to a custom text editor, . Which data structure would be ideally suited to implement this feature?




Hash tables are ideal for assigning and retrieving data in the fastest way possible, not for tracking the most recently added item.
